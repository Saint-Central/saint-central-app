- **API Key Rotation**

  - Support for seamless API key rotation
  - Grace period for previous keys during rotation
  - Secure key validation mechanisms

- **Permissions Model**
  - Fine-grained permission validation
  - Role-based access control support

### Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**

  - CSRF token generation and validation
  - Token rotation on each request
  - Secure cookie handling with proper flags

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**

  - Content escaping for different contexts (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URLs)
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
  - Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

- **SQL Injection Prevention**

  - Parameter validation and sanitization
  - Type checking for all inputs
  - Maximum length enforcement

- **Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection**
  - IP-based rate limiting
  - Token-based rate limiting
  - Login attempt tracking and temporary blocking
  - Exponential backoff for repeated failed attempts

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data Handling**

  - Data masking in logs and error messages
  - Automatic detection of sensitive fields
  - Secure logging practices

- **Secure Transport**

  - HTTPS enforcement
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Certificate validation

- **Request Integrity**
  - Request signing to prevent tampering
  - Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
  - Payload validation

### Advanced Security Features

- **Attack Detection**

  - Request pattern analysis to detect automated attacks
  - Behavioral analysis to detect suspicious activity
  - Penetration testing detection

- **Security Hardening**

  - Browser security feature detection
  - Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Feature Policy enforcement

- **Secure Storage**
  - Encrypted local storage for tokens
  - Session management with secure defaults
  - Storage availability detection

## Security Modules

### 1. Core Security (`security.ts`)

Primary security module providing fundamental security features:

- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection
- Token blacklisting
- Request signing
- Input validation
- API key rotation
- Security constants

### 2. SDK Security (`sdkSecurity.ts`)

Client-side security features for the SDK:

- Secure token storage
- Request pattern analysis
- Secure fetch wrapper
- Sensitive data masking
- Permission validation
- Secure logging
- Browser security detection

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of creating a client with enhanced security:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "./sdk";

// Create a client with enhanced security
const client = createClient("https://api.example.com", {
  // Enable security features
  securityOptions: {
    enableCsrfProtection: true,
    enableRequestSigning: true,
    signatureSecret: "your-signing-secret",
    validateInputs: true,
    maxBatchSize: 500,
    enableEncryption: true,
    encryptionKey: "your-encryption-key",
  },
});

// Use the secure client
const response = await client.from("users").select("id, name, email").eq("active", true).get();
```

## Security Best Practices for SDK Usage

1. **Always use HTTPS**

   - Never send sensitive data over unencrypted connections
   - Enable strict HTTPS with proper certificate validation

2. **Implement Proper Authentication**

   - Use the built-in auth mechanisms
   - Implement proper logout procedures
   - Rotate refresh tokens periodically

3. **Input Validation**

   - Always validate user input before sending to the API
   - Use the SDK's validation features for additional protection

4. **Handle Errors Securely**

   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Use the SecureLogger to mask sensitive data

5. **Keep the SDK Updated**

   - Regularly update to the latest version for security patches
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies

6. **Secure Token Storage**

   - Use the SecureTokenStorage for client-side storage
   - Implement server-side session validation

7. **Minimize Attack Surface**
   - Only request the permissions and data you need
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

## Security Headers

The SDK automatically applies the following security headers:

| Header                    | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Security-Policy   | Prevents XSS and data injection attacks      |
| X-Content-Type-Options    | Prevents MIME type sniffing                  |
| X-Frame-Options           | Prevents clickjacking                        |
| X-XSS-Protection          | Additional XSS protection for older browsers |
| Strict-Transport-Security | Enforces HTTPS usage                         |
| Referrer-Policy           | Controls referrer information                |
| Feature-Policy            | Restricts browser features                   |
| Cache-Control             | Prevents sensitive data caching              |

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@example.com. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

## Future Security Enhancements
